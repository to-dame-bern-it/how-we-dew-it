# Description
A Trello-like task manager application where background videos were incorporated for extra motivation. This app allows you to create tasks, drag, drop, and delete them as needed. If there is just too much on your list and you need some motivation then you can hide your tasks and watch one of the many motivational videos provided. You can simply click the extra motivation button for audio. After having Shia Labeouf demand that you, "JUST DO IT!", Kid President lift your spirits, or Matt Foley explain how you could end up like him, "living in a van DOWN BY THE RIVER!" then you will be ready to go back to your tasks and complete them with conviction.
